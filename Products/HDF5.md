## HDF5

[back](../scorecards.md)

### Description

HDF5 is a self-describing, portable, and hierarchical file format designed for high-performance I/O and featuring various integrated features that can help optimize storage space and access time. Because it can optimize system-tailored I/O at scale, HDF5 is widely used by industry, academic, and government organizations. It's also highly compatible with other systems, making data sharing, collaboration, and analysis quick and trouble-free.

### Impact, Sustainability, and Quality
