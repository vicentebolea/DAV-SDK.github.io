## ParaView

[back](../scorecards.md)

### Description

ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

ParaView and Catalyst form the backbone of DOE’s production visualization at scale capability. Together they provide a set of C++ libraries for general-purpose visualization, a production visualization tool designed to support visualization at scale, and an in situ visualization infrastructure designed to be integrated with applications to reduce I/O overhead.

### Impact, Sustainability, and Quality

        <strong>Impact</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        ParaView forms the backbone of DOE’s production visualization at scale capability. It is deployed at all major DOE computing facilities and is used daily for analysis and visualization.

      <td>
        <strong>Sustainability</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        The fundamental capabilities that ParaView provides are widely used and have a fairly sustainable funding stream. On the other hand, the next-generation capabilities that ParaView provides, ranging from support for accelerators to distributed visualization at scale, are highly dependent on DOE funding.
